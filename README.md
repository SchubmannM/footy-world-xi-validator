# Footy World XI Validator

The intention of this app is to be a validator for a little game that was started on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MundialMag/status/1250080258122022915

```
Pick the greatest World XI under these the rules:
 
- No two players from the same country
- No two can have played for the same club
- All eleven have to have played in your lifetime
```

The app asks you to enter 11 different footballer names and then runs a validation to check if any of the above stated rules were broken or not.

Version 1 does not include the "played in your lifetime" rule as that's still a bit vague to be defined in code.

This is the CLI version of the program. A web version is also available here: https://github.com/SchubmannM/footy-world-xi-validator-web and live here https://footy.schubmann.dev/

# Setup
1. Clone this directory onto your local environment: `git clone https://github.com/SchubmannM/footy-world-xi-validator.git && cd footy-world-xi-validator/`
3. Run `python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pipenv` to install pipenv locally (or run `brew install pipenv` on MacOS). If this does not work, refer to https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-pipenv for more instructions.
4. Run `pipenv sync && pipenv shell` to install all packages needed to run this programa and enable the virtual environment
5. Run `python main.py`to run the program
